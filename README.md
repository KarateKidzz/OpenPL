# OpenPL (Open Propagation Library)

[![OpenPL Builder](https://github.com/KarateKidzz/OpenPL/actions/workflows/openpl_build.yml/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://github.com/KarateKidzz/OpenPL/actions/workflows/openpl_build.yml)

OpenPL is a [University of Portsmouth](https://www.port.ac.uk/) dissertation project to learn about [Project Triton/Acoustics](https://github.com/microsoft/ProjectAcoustics).

Written with [JUCE v6.0.7](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE).

## Installing

Check each folder for specifc instructions for installing each module.

In general, if the module requires external dependencies, a `Setup` script will be included. In cases where no external tools are needed, you can open the `.jucer` file straight away in the Projucer application, provided by JUCE.

## Viewing and Editing

Some modules have IDE projects included. Opening these files will allow quick editing.

However, if the projects aren't included, they can be generated by opening the `.jucer` in JUCE's Projucer application and saving/exporting.

## Building

Use the Projucer and your IDE to build.

If the project includes a Makefile in the LinuxMakefile directory, simply run `make` in the LinuxMakefile directory.
