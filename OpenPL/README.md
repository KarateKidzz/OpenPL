This folder contains the main editor library which should be added to a game engine's editor to allow for wave simulation.

 Open Propagation Library

 Development Notes to Self:
 
 Editor Flow (Uses this library)
 -------------------
 
 1. Engine Editor Loads
 2. Load OpenPL
 3. Run Simulation over game scene(s)*
 4. Shutdown Editor
 5. Shutdown OpenPL
 
 Runtime Flow (Uses custom wrapper for Wwise/FMOD)
 -------------------
 At runtime, it's up to the engine to read data previously made by the simulation. OpenPL is not needed at this point.
 
 1. Load Game
 2. Load Scene
 3. Connect to Wwise/FMOD reverb bus plugin
 4. Load Simulation Data from Disk as needed
 5. Send simple simulation data as parameters to event/gameobject
 6. Send IRs to reverb bus plugin
 
 *Simulation Flow
 -------------------
 
 1. Pass in game geometry
 2. Voxelise the geometry
 3. Return the voxel geometry for scene debugging and visualisation
 4. Apply Rectangular Decomposition
 5. Run Simulation
 6. Pick out salient parameters
 7. Save data to disk
 8. Return success
